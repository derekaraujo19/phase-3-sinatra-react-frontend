# Song.portfolio

SONG.PORTFOLIO is a one-stop shop for musicians and song creators to keep a record of their work.  It lets users create, edit, and delete song entries, as well as their corresponding albums.  Unlike the current methods of music archiving that artists flock to, like Google Drive and Dropbox, SONG.PORTFOLIO allows the user to log and perform queries based on certain musical attributues.
